## How to Hydrate

### Hydrating using Hydrator (GUI)

### Hydrating using Twarc (CLI)

First install twarc and tqdm

```
pip3 install twarc
pip3 install tqdm
```

Configure twarc with your Twitter API tokens (you must apply for a Twitter developer account first in order to generate these tokens). You can also configure the API tokens by running the command:

```
twarc configure
```
Then you can run the script. The hydrated tweets will be stored in the same folder that contains the tweets' IDs as a compressed jsonl file. 

### Hydrating using Tweepy
